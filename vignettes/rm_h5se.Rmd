Key database files are contained in directories `h5se_rg`, `h5_gr`, and `h5_gm`. These contain assay files with DNAm data. In R, these are handled as objects of class , which utilizes DelayedArray `HDF5-SummarizedExperiment`. 

This vignette provides an example workflow that  DelayedArray technology to speed up queries of large datasets, such as the  database files. For expediency, this uses a small test dataset, but similar principles apply to the full dataaset objects.

# Obtain test datasets

First, H5SE test datasets, `h5se_rg_test`, `h5se_gr_test`, and `h5se_gm_test`, can be downloaded from `recount.bio/data`. 

# Metadata queries



Next, access the metadata with `minfi::pData(h5se_rg_test)`.
