Recount Methylation data are contained in 3 directories, `h5se_rg`, `h5_gr`, and `h5_gm`. These contain assay files with DNAm data.

In R, these are handled as objects of class `HDF5-SummarizedExperiment`, which utilizes DelayedArray. This vignette provides an example workflow compatible with the DelayedArray backend to speed up queries of large datasets, such as the  database files. 

For expediency, this uses a small test , but similar principles apply to the full dataaset objects.

# Obtain test datasets

First, H5SE test datasets, `h5se_rg_test`, `h5se_gr_test`, and `h5se_gm_test`, can be downloaded from `recount.bio/data`. 

# Metadata queries

Next, access the metadata with `minfi::pData(h5se_rg_test)`.
