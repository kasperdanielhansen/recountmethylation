# Overview

DNAm assay data and sample metadata available as of March 2019 
were 
piped into HDF5-based SummarizedExperiment objects between 
about 80-130Gb in size. The most compact data is the `gr` of 
class `GenomicRanges`, and the largest object is `rg` of class `RGChannelSet`.

## Download data
Use `HDF5Array` to 
H5SE objects were stored using `saveHDF5SummarizedExperiment`

# Query data

The `HDF5-SummarizedExperiment` objects use `DelayedArray` 
backend,
which enables rapid querying and delayed execution of 
memory-intensive processes. 
Use `loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment` from `HDF5Array`, as in 
`h5se <- loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment(path)`,
where `path` is the path to the downloaded 
`HDF5-SummarizedExperiment` object. Then access metadata 
using `pData` from `minfi`, as in `pData(h5se)`.

# Example with test dataset

First obtain the test data from `recount.bio/data` with 
`get_rmdl()`, which returns the path we'll use to load 
the data.

Once data is successfully downloaded, use the returned 
path to load data into an R session with 
`loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment()` from `HDF5Array`.

```{r, testdat.dl, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
datapath <- get_rmdl("h5se-test_gr", verbose = FALSE)
grtest <- HDF5Array::loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment(datapath)
dim(grtest)
```

The object `grtest` can then be summarized `dim()` and 
utilized in an analysis pipeline with `minfi` 
functions like `pData()`, `getBeta()`, `getAnnotation()` and so forth.

# Session info

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
sessionInfo()
